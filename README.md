# RC_CAR_MADE_BY_ALIF
I made a rc car using aduino and Bluetooth module.
In This project Named "RC_Car" which Is actually a bluetooth control Car. We used here some component which is manually controlled by a microcontroller Named "Arduino" . We used here 2 motor and a 360 wheel for running the car. We used a motor driver named "L298" , which is guving a controlled power to the motor. We also used a bluetooth module named "HC05" which actually send some character by an external software, which give a instruction to the Arduino UNO board. 
And These are the component i used in this project.
